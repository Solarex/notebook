Essential command line tools

When developing in IDEs or editors other than Eclipse, be familiar with all of the tools below, because you will have to run them from the command line.

+ [android](https://developer.android.com/tools/help/android.html) Create and update Android projects and create, move, and delete AVDs.
+ [Android Emulator](https://developer.android.com/tools/devices/emulator.html) Run your Android applications on an emulated Android platform.
+ [Android Debug Bridge](https://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html) Interface with your emulator or connected device (install apps, shell the device, issue commands, etc.).

In addition to the above tools that are included with the SDK, you need the following open source and third-party tools:

+ Ant To compile and build your Android project into an installable .apk file.
+ Keytool To generate a keystore and private key, used to sign your .apk file. Keytool is part of the JDK.
+ Jarsigner (or similar signing tool) To sign your .apk file with a private key generated by Keytool. Jarsigner is part of the JDK.
